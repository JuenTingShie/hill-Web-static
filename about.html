            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>According to the statistics of the United Nations University, there is about <mark>41 million tons of
                    global
                    electronic wastes</mark>, which worth over NT$1.5 trillion in 2014. Unfortunately, only 6
                million tons of electronics been used properly. That’s why our vision is to extend the life-cycle of
                used electronics. We hope to provide a trading platform for used electronic products, for those who
                don’t need them anymore, and also for those who want to buy electronics but don’t have enough money to
                buy a new one.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Hill was established since 2019. To extend the life-cycle of used electronics is the core concept of our
                company. The online trading of second handed electronics expects to start in January, 2020. We provide
                price trend, tags, forum and user-friendly consultation to bring convenience to consumers.
            </p>
